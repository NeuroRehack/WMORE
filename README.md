This project aims at providing an opensource platform for synchronised inertial measurements.
This platform consist of a list of required components, firmware to run the components and a software user interface. 

The project comprises two types of sensors: a logger and a coordinator. The coordinator is responsible for initiating and stopping the recording on the loggers while ensuring that they remain synchronized. Only one coordinator is required to operate a group of loggers.

# **Set Up**
## **Hardware**
### **Required Components**
---
The WMOREs were designed using the list of components bellow. Only the Arduino Nano and Artemis Openlog are required to run the firmware, the battery and switches can be swapped for different models. However the CAD models for the case will need to be modified or redesigned accordingly if you choose to do so. At least 2 WMOREs must be assembled:

 * [Arduino Nano ble 33 (Sense)](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense)
 * [SparkFun OpenLog Artemis (OLA)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16832)
 * [Slide switch](https://www.digikey.com.au/en/products/detail/c-k/OS102011MS2QN1/411602)
 * [Tactile Switch](https://www.digikey.com.au/en/products/detail/te-connectivity-alcoswitch-switches/1825910-6/1632536)
 * [LiPo Battery 500mAh 3.7V 503035](https://ecocell.com.au/product/lipo-500-503035/)
 * 500 mm of 30 AWG hook up wire
 * A [4.7kÎ© 0402 surface mount resistor](https://www.digikey.com.au/en/products/detail/panasonic-electronic-components/ERA-2AEB472X/1706021)
 * A MicroSDXC V30 U3 C10 A2
 * Sim card tray pin (for pressing the reset button)
 * USB type A to USB type C cable

It is recommended to flash the Arduino Nano's and OLA's firmware before soldering and assembling the components into the case as this makes testing and debugging easier. It's especially important to do so for the Arduino Nano as once the case closed the Nano's micro USB is no longer accessibe ðŸ˜‰.

### **Soldering The Components**
---
Before wiring the components together, the OLA must be modified in 2 ways:
1. The JST connector needs to be removed, in order for the Openlog to fit in the case. The battery will directly be wired to the pins underneath it. To do so disconnect the two surface mount pins of the JST connector (see [Figure 1](/Documentation/OpenLog_JST_Desolder_Location.jpg)) by cutting them off of the PCB using flush cutters, then silde the JST connector off its rails by pushing it away from the border of the PCB. The OLA should now look like the picture in [Figure 2](/Documentation/OpenLog_JST_Desoldered.jpg).

2. The OLA has a charge current of approximately 450 mA. The 500 mAh Ecocell 503035P that is used in the WMOREs has a recommended charge current of 100 mA. If this battery is used then the OLA charge current must be reduced to 100 mA for safe operation. To achieve this, desolder the R4 resistor (which location is shown in [Figure 3.](/Documentation/Openlog_Battery_Voltage_Regulator_Resistor.jpg)) and replace it with a 4.7kÎ© 0402 surface mount resistor.

The male JST connector on the battery also needs to be cut off.

Use the wiring diagram below to solder the components together.

### **Assembling The Case**
---

Once soldered place the components in to the case as follows:  

**MAKE SURE THE SLIDE SWITCH IN THE OFF POSITION WHILE ASSEMBLING!**
1. Place the Arduino Nano inside the top half of the case (see [Figure 5](Documentation/Case_Mechanical_Drawing.png)) with the micro usb port facing the back.
2. Place the Push Button and Slide Switch in their respective frames  
   Make sure that the two soldered pin of the Slide Switch are towards the front. This is an arbitrary direction so that turning on the sensor is consistenly done by sliding the switch forward .
3. Place the OLA on the supporting pegs of the top half of the case with the USB C port flush against the opening.
4. Place the SD card into the SD card slot of the OLA (for the Loggers only).
5. Place the Battery inside the bottom half of the case.
6. Join the two halves of the case.  
   Make sure the Battery cables are not stuck between the OLA SD card slot and the Battery.

## **Firmware**
### **Openlog Artemis (OLA)**
---
The Coordinator and Logger OLA firmware applications are based on v2.3 of the Openlog Artemis application supplied by Sparkfun (https://github.com/sparkfun/OpenLog_Artemis). Both the OLA firmware applications were developed using the Openlog Artemis board support package installed on version 1.8.12 of the Arduino IDE. 

The Coordinator and Logger OLA firmware applications are predominantly written in Arduino C++, but include calls to the AmbiqSuiteSDK (mirrored by Sparkfun at https://github.com/sparkfun/AmbiqSuiteSDK). The original Openlog Artemis application has been significantly modified for the WMORE to enable synchronisation and to reduce processing delays. Some of the original functionality has been lost as a result. 

The Arduino project for the OLA can be found in the [OpenLog_Logger](Firmware/OpenLog_Logger) and [OpenLog_Coordinator](/Firmware/OpenLog_Coordinator/) folders under [Firmware](/Firmware/).

Connect the OLA to your computer, select the correct com port and press the upload button. The project may take a while to compile
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### **Nano**
---
The Coordinator and Logger Nano applications are written using **v2.1.0** of the **Nordic Semiconductor nRF Connect SDK** in the **Visual Studio Code** IDE and based on the nRF Connect SDK Enhanced Shockburst sample (**ESB ptx**) applications. The nRF Connect SDK is based on the Zephyr RTOS, and Zephyr API calls are used in the WMORE applications. 

It is only necessary to install the nRF Connect SDK if you intend to modify this project. If that is the case, this link is a good starting point: [https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-software/nrf-connect-sdk]. The Documentation, Get Started, and nRF Connect Fundamentals links are particularly useful: 
[https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/introduction.html]
[https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-software/nRF-Connect-SDK/GetStarted#infotabs]
[https://academy.nordicsemi.com/courses/nrf-connect-sdk-fundamentals/].

The nRF Connect SDK and the Zephyr RTOS involve a fairly complex structure of files and dependencies. Fully documenting this is well beyond the scope of this document. Of particular note however are several `.overlay`, `.dts`, and `.conf` files that are used to set up or check project-specific peripherals and pin mappings. For instance:

`<path_to_project>\<project_name>\boards\arduino_nano_33_ble.overlay` sets UART speed and GPIO pin mappings for the Nanos.

`<path_to_project>\<project_name>\arduino_nano_33_ble\zephyr\zephyr.dts` is a system-generated file that allows many peripheral settings to be checked.

`<path_to_project>\<project_name>\prj.conf` is a configuration file that is sometimes relevant when adding new peripherals.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### **Building The Zephyr Project**
---
1. Install nRF Connect SDK v2.1.0 by following [this tutorial](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-software/nRF-Connect-SDK/GetStarted#infotabs)
2. In the NRf connect SDK extension in VS code click on the Create a new Aplication button
3. Select Workspace as application type
4. Select Toolcahin Version 2.1.0 
5. Select Sample `nrf/samples/esb/prx` for the Logger or `nrf/samples/esb/ptx` for the Coordinator
6. Replace the `source/main.c` file with [Firmware/Nano_Coordinator/src/main.c](/Firmware/Nano_Coordinator/src/main.c) or [Firmware/Nano_Logger/src/main.c](/Firmware/Nano_Logger/src/main.c)
7. replace the `prj.conf` file with [Firmware/Nano_Coordinator/prj.conf](/Firmware/Nano_Coordinator/prj.conf) or [Firmware/Nano_Logger/prj.conf](/Firmware/Nano_Logger/prj.conf)
8. Add the [overlay](/Firmware/Nano_Coordinator/boards/arduino_nano_33_ble.overlay) file to the project
9. Click on the `Add Build Configuration` button next the application you just created under the Applications tab in the to the  In the applications tab in the NRf Connect extension
10. Select `All Boards` under Board and search for `arduino_nano_ble_sense`
11. Click build configuration.
12. 
You should now be able to build the project. You can follow the steps in the next sessions to flash the Nano with the generated `.bin` file. The `.bin` have been rename `coordinator.bin` and `logger.bin` in the following section for more clarity however they can be found here: `<path_to_project>\<build_folder>\zephyr\zephyr.bin`.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### **Uploading Firmware To Nano**
---

In order to flash the firmware to the Arduino nano, it is also necessary to install the bossac utility. An easy way to do this is to install the Arduino IDE, which should already have been done to support programming the OLA.


- Connect the Nano to the computer and press the white tactile button twice (the orange LED should start flashing)

- Identify the path to the `coordinator.bin` or `logger.bin` file which can be found at :
  - For the Logger: [<path_to_project>/Firmware/Nano_Logger/logger.bin](Firmware/Nano_Logger/logger.bin)
  - For the Coordinator: [<path_to_project>/Firmware/Nano_Coordinator/coordinator.bin)](Firmware/Nano_Coordinator/coordinator.bin)
  - If you have built the project yourself: `<path_to_project>\<build_folder>\zephyr\zephyr.bin`

- Open a terminal window (search cmd) in the folder where bossac.exe is located, which should be of the form: `C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\arduino\tools\bossac\1.9.1-arduino2`

- Enter the following command line for the Coordinator: 
  ```sh
  .\bossac -d --port=<COMxx> -U -i -e -w <path_to_project>/Firmware/Nano_Coordinator/coordinator.bin -R
  ```
  and for the Logger:
  ```sh
  .\bossac -d --port=<COMxx> -U -i -e -w <path_to_project>/Firmware/Nano_Logger/logger.bin -R
  ```
  
**NOTE** : The appropriate .bin file **<path_to_project>** and **\<COMxx\>** should be substituted. The com port number can be found using the Device Manager. 

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## **Software**
---
All interections with the WMOREs can be done through a serial monitor such as [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) or [Tera Term](http://www.teraterm.org/). However, for convenience, a python program was written to simplify some of the repetitive tasks. The source code is available in the [Software](/Software/) folder. This code can be run either from python or using the executable.

If you wish to modify the code follow these steps:
* Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (tested with versin 3.9.16) and don't forget to tick the `Add Python 3.x to PATH` box
* (Optional) Create and activate your environment
* Open a terminal in the [Software](/Software/) folder and run:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
* Run [WMORE_HUB.pyw](/Software/WMORE_HUB.pyw) from a code editor like VS Code

Ohterwise download and extract [WMORE.zip](/Software/WMORE.zip) and run `WMORE_HUB.exe`.

You also need to install [Tera Term](http://www.teraterm.org/) in order to download the data off of the WMOREs. The program may take a minute or two the first time you run it as it is searching for the location of Tera Term on your computer.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

# **Using the WMOREs**
Once you have assemble at least one Coordinator and Logger connect them to a computer. Launch WMORE_HUB. 

As explained before all interactions with the WMOREs can be done through a serial monitor. However, the program allows the user to automate some of the more repetitive and complex tasks such as:
* Finding the WMOREs' com port and connecting to a WMORE
* Setting the Real Time Clock (RTC) on the Coordinator
* Formatting the SD card on the Loggers
* Downloading the data off of the Loggers
* Converting the data from `.bin` to `.csv` (can only be done using WMORE_HUB or see [BinToCSV.py](/Software/BinToCSV.py))


<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## **Recording**
---
The step for recording from the WMOREs are as follow:

1. Turn the Logger(s) and the Coordinator on using the slide switch on the side of the sensor
2. Reset the sensor using a sim card tray pin (or push button for Loggers)
3. Connect the sensors to your computer
4. (Optional) Set the ID on the Logger(s) and Coordinator using the serial monitor (see the `"WMORE Settings"` section below)
5. Format the SD card on the Logger(s)
6. Unplug the Logger(s), power cycle it/them (reset before turning)
7. Set the RTC on the Coordinator
8. Unplug the Coordinator and reset it using the sim card tray pin **DO NOT SWITCH IT OFF!**
9. Reset the Logger(s)
10. Press the push button on the Coordinator to start recording. The LEDs should turn from solid red to solid blue (see the `"WMORE LED colour code"` section below)
    
Keep the Loggers within a meter of the Coordinator through out the recording. A recording must last at least 1 minute for synchronisation to be effective.

10.  Press the push button on the Coordinator to stop recording. The LEDs should turn from solid blue to solid red
11.  Connect the Logger(s) to the computer
12. Download the data off of the loggers
13. Turn off WMOREs (it's a good idea to reset them too after they are off)
14. Delete empty files (bin file with 0kB)
15. Convert the data from `.bin` to `.csv`

Here is a short tutorial video showing the steps above:

## **WMORE Settings**
---
There are some note worthy settings that are only accessible via the serial monitor:
* Configure Terminal Output (1):
  *  Setting sampling frequency (4)
  *  Setting max file size (10)
  *  Setting the ID of the sensor (22):
* Configure Time Stamp (2):
  * Enabling/Disabling logging Date (1), Time (2) and Microseconds (10)
* Configure IMU Logging (3):
  * Enabling/Disabling Sensor logging (1), Accelerometer (2), Gyroscope (3), Magnetometer (4) and Temperature (5)
  * Setting sensor ranges (6 and 9)
  * Enabling/Disabling Filters (7 and 10)
  * Setting filter type (8 and 11)
* Configure Power Options (7):
  * Low Battery Voltage Detection (4) should be disabled

## **WMORE LED Colour Code**
---
Here are the various color sequences and patterns for the different states of the WMOREs.  
When turning off the sensors all the LEDs should turn off if they don't reset the sensor.
